# The New York Times COVID19 batch processor

_The New York Times_ has kindly put out information people can use to monitor the flow
of the outbreak in the US, [available here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). 
That data is on Github and it powers their already [superb visualization of the data here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#g-cases-over-time).

This is a Spring Batch `job` to ingest that data for analysis and then subsequent visualization.
